# Mask-Detection-System
This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using computer vision techniques. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces in real-time, and classifies whether each detected face is wearing a mask or not. The application leverages OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module for robust face detection.
